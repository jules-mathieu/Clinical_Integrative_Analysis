	abstract = {Graphics are widely used to provide summarization of complex data in scientific publications. Although there are many tools available for drawing graphics, their use is limited by programming skills, costs, and platform specificities. Here, we presented a freely accessible easy-to-use web server named SRplot that integrated more than a hundred of commonly used data visualization and graphing functions together. It can be run easily using all Web browsers and there are no strong requirements on the computing power of users’ machines. With a user-friendly graphical interface, users can simply paste the contents of the input file into the text box according to the defined file format. Modification operations can be easily performed, and graphs can be generated in real-time. The resulting graphs can be easily downloaded in bitmap (PNG or TIFF) or vector (PDF or SVG) format in publication quality. The website is updated promptly and continuously. Functions in SRplot have been improved, optimized and updated depend on feedback and suggestions from users. The graphs prepared with SRplot have been featured in more than five hundred peer-reviewed publications. The SRplot web server is now freely available at http://www.bioinformatics.com.cn/SRplot.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Long-standing clinical predictors of cancer survival have included histopathologic type, stage, and grade. We hypothesized that the principal categories of tumor somatic mutations might also portend survival. We investigated this hypothesis using the Pan-Cancer Atlas, encompassing clinical, genomic, and outcome data of 10,652 patients and 32 cancer types.
METHODS: We evaluated the prognostic capability of cancer type, stage, grade and the burden of each major mutation category on overall and disease-specific survival. Mutation categories included short substitution and insertion-deletion mutations (SMs), copy number alterations (CNAs), and gene fusions.
RESULTS: SM count and CNA fraction proved to be strong independent predictors of survival (joint P = 5.3e-95) that remained highly significant when adjusted for the traditional factors. Importantly, the relationship between mutation burden and survival proved to be nonlinear (P = 9.5e-56); survival improved at both low- and high-burden extremes. In clinically predictive modeling, SM count together with CNA fraction meaningfully distinguished survival even among patients sharing a given cancer type, stage, or grade.
CONCLUSION: Burden of somatic mutation is a key index of survival of analogous clinical utility to these traditional factors.},

	abstract = {The digitization of health records and growing availability of tumour DNA sequencing provide an opportunity to study the determinants of cancer outcomes with unprecedented richness. Patient data are often stored in unstructured text and siloed datasets. Here we combine natural language processing annotations1,2 with structured medication, patient-reported demographic, tumour registry and tumour genomic data from 24,950 patients at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center to generate a clinicogenomic, harmonized oncologic real-world dataset (MSK-CHORD). MSK-CHORD includes data for non-small-cell lung (n = 7,809), breast (n = 5,368), colorectal (n = 5,543), prostate (n = 3,211) and pancreatic (n = 3,109) cancers and enables discovery of clinicogenomic relationships not apparent in smaller datasets. Leveraging MSK-CHORD to train machine learning models to predict overall survival, we find that models including features derived from natural language processing, such as sites of disease, outperform those based on genomic data or stage alone as tested by cross-validation and an external, multi-institution dataset. By annotating 705,241 radiology reports, MSK-CHORD also uncovers predictors of metastasis to specific organ sites, including a relationship between SETD2 mutation and lower metastatic potential in immunotherapy-treated lung adenocarcinoma corroborated in independent datasets. We demonstrate the feasibility of automated annotation from unstructured notes and its utility in predicting patient outcomes. The resulting data are provided as a public resource for real-world oncologic research.},
